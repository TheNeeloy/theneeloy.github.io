## Nice to meet you!
I'm an undergraduate senior studying computer engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/)'s [ECE Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/), with a particular focus in robotics & reinforcement learning. My passion lies in learning about & developing safe autonomous systems that can collaborate with people. In an age where robots exist in practically every field imaginable, I think it's truly important to consider the design process of these machines that can operate effectively with others around them. I am currently completing my senior thesis under [Professor Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/) in the [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/). Learn more about my research, industry, & teaching experience (as well as fun side projects) by clicking the tabs at the top of this site. Thanks for visiting!
