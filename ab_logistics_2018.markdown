## Responsibilities
I had my first internship as a university student during the summer of 2018, where I had the pleasure of interning at Anheuser Busch's Logistics Group. Specifically, I had the opportunity to support a key decision making team known as the Supply Network Planning team. This subgroup chooses which brewery barrels of beer of a certain SKU are sourced from, which wholesaler they should end up at, and by how much quantity. These three factors impact an important key performance indicator known as allocation, which impacts the budget set aside to the group.  
  
This summer, I was tasked with developing new-in-position tutorial materials detailing the process behind calculating the allocation KPI, & creating clear visualizations with a tool known as Qlik Sense, so that the team has a straight forward method of identifying the state of allocation on any particular day. 

## My Expectations
As this was my first internship as a university student, I was looking forward to gain experience working on larger scale projects, that would positively impact others at the company. Specifically, just like I was new to the team, I had to consider how to make new-in-position tutorial materials easy to understand and effective at teaching the necessary tasks to perform well on the team. In that sense, I looked forward to growing close to the SNP team and learning more about Anheuser Busch's culture. Second, I was ready to push myself to learn SQL querying, which I had little experience with earlier. With SQL & QlikSense, I was excited to use my creativity to create cool dashboards for the team.

## Results
By the end of the internship, I developed an easy to understand tutorial explaining allocation calculations, with interactive lessons for new hires. Secondly, I collaborated with the SNP team to identify what visualizations would be necessary to allow them to efficiently make decisions based on allocation KPIs, & developed dashboards with Qlik Sense. And last but certainly not least, I made incredible friends & connections with coworkers & interns through awesome activities like paintball!
